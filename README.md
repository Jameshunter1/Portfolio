## Developer Portfolio

This portfolio website is a prime example of modern web development, built using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity.io. The website showcases the ability to build fast, responsive, and visually appealing web applications using cutting-edge technologies and frameworks.

The use of Next.js and React has enabled the creation of a modular and efficient codebase, allowing for improved performance and faster loading times. Additionally, the use of Tailwind CSS has facilitated the creation of a consistent and modern design language throughout the website, making it easy to navigate and visually appealing. Furthermore, the integration of Sanity.io as a content management system has made it simple to manage and update portfolio items, providing a flexible and scalable infrastructure for future development.

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system before proceeding.

## Installation

 1. Clone the repository using the following command:

 `git clone https://github.com/Jameshunter1/Portfolio.git`

 2. Navigate to the project directory using:

 `cd Portfolio`

 3. Install the project dependencies using:

 `npm install`

 4. Start the development server using:

  `npm run dev`

 5. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.


## Features

 - Implemented the contact form functionality, allowing users to submit their information and open their local email app with pre-populated fields for easy sending.
 - Automated deployment and continuous integration using Vercel.
 - Server-side rendering for improved performance and SEO.
 - Integration with Sanity.io content management system for easy content updates.
 


##  Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev

 or
 
yarn dev

 or
 
pnpm dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.js.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel
The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the Vercel Platform from the creators of Next.js. Check out our Next.js deployment documentation for more details.

## Configuration

To configure Sanity.io, you will need to create a free account and set up a new project. Once you have your project ID and dataset name, you can update the sanity.js file in the utils folder with your configuration details.
